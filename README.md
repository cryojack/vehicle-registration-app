# vehicle-registration-app
A very basic vehicle tracker app that uses jQuery AJAX to make calls to the database and display and update information.

This app is not very fancy and would still require some tweaks, but at the very basic, it allows you to
- Create a vehicle with a unique vehicle name and unique vehicle owner
- Add job cards to the vehicle
- Add services to the job cards
- Delete services and jobs
- Show the vehicle details, including the jobs and services
- Automatically update the job card price on insert/update/delete of services
- Demonstration of jQuery AJAX
- This is a beginner app hence it's not very pretty :)
